      Welcome to Listly to-do list app! This app is designed to help you keep
      track of your tasks and stay organized. Here are a few tips to get
      started:

      Add tasks: To begin, tap the "+" button or the "Add Task" option to create
      a new task. Enter a short and clear description of the task you want to
      add.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mark tasks as complete: When you finish a task, simply tap on it to mark
      it as complete. This will help you track your progress and see what tasks
      are still pending.
    </p>
    <p>
      Delete or edit tasks: If you want to remove a task from your list, click
      on the delete option. If you need to make changes to a task, tap on it to
      edit the description or any other details.
    </p>
    <p>
      Clear completed tasks: Over time, your completed tasks can accumulate. To
      keep your list clean and focused, look for the option to clear or delete
      completed tasks. This will help you maintain a clutter-free view.
